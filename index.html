        Hamas’ October 7 massacre in Israel included torture, murder, the kidnapping of hundreds of
        innocent people, and even the post-mortem desecration of bodies. It also included rape and
        sexual assault of female victims, though this has received far less attention by the news
        media.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, some ghoulish anti-Israel detractors even claimed the rapes never happened,
        effectively spitting in the face of assault victims. It’s time for the news media to condemn
        the heinous actions, not just of Hamas, but of those who seek to downplay their horrific
        sexual assaults.
